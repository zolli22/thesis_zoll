INTRO PARAGRAPH SUMMARIZING RESULTS

## Effect of Tree Delineation and Pixel Selection Techniques

The three pixel selection methods (point, radius, and LiDAR) were used
to help answer the question "which pixels are we using?"

```{r layered-outputs-2, out.width = "90%", fig.cap = "Point, Radius, and LiDAR pixel selection methods for Berkeley Park with numbered trees", fig.scap = "Pixel selection method comparison with numbered trees", echo = F}
include_graphics("figure/layered_outputs_2.png")

```

The point method is the simplest method, obtaining a single NDVI value
from the individual pixel that spatially contains an individual tree
location point. The statistically significant difference in the NDVI
values for trees categorized as **fair** and **good** seems to be
primarily driven by the THPL data.

Given that only one pixel value is used to represent the NDVI of an
entire tree in the point method, that single pixel likely misrepresents
the health of the tree. If the location point is incorrect, the NDVI
value may not belong to the tree of interest. The pixel method NDVI
values statistically significantly higher than the NDVI values obtained
through the other two pixel selection methods. This can be attributed to
the use of a single pixel rather than an average of pixel NDVI values.
The approximated center of the tree represented by the tree location
point will generally be greener than pixels on the edge because the NDVI
value for a pixel is the average NDVI for all data within that pixel,
and the central pixel likely contains mostly tree canopy, and ideally
little to no information on ground cover surrounding the tree. This is
emphasized in figure \@ref(fig:layered-outputs-2), which highlights the
large variance in pixel selection extent for the three methods and how
much data is missed by the point method.

The radius method averages the NDVI values of pixels within a buffered
circle with the size defined by the measured or predicted tree canopy
width. This data had a statistically significant difference in average
NDVI values between **good** and **poor** categorized trees as well as
**good** and **fair** categorized trees. There is a larger difference
between **fair** and **good** than **fair** and **poor**, which is also
seen in the point method data.

Where the scope of the pixel data is too narrow (only using the value of
a singular pixel) the scope of the radius method can be too broad and
pixels belonging to other trees will be included.

A large issue that can arise with the radius method data is the
overlapping of tree crowns, and pixels being used in the NDVI analysis
for multiple trees (Figure \@ref(fig:overlap-crowns). Overlapping crowns
is an issue that often arises with tree crown delineation. To deal with
this, @xiao2005 chose to exclude any trees with overlapping crowns from
the final analysis. @fang2020 used a version of the radius method where
they calculated an average canopy width and used that standardized size
(a radius of 4.55 m) to extract their NDVI averages for each tree. The
paper does not mention how they dealt with overlapping tree crowns, but
perhaps their trees were widely distributed enough and the radius of
interest was small enough that their values did not experience overlap.
Using LiDAR as a pixel selection method has the benefit of additional
pixel data like the radius method, but no overlapping crowns.

```{r overlap-crowns, out.width = "50%", fig.scap = "Examples of overlapping park and street tree crowns.", fig.cap = "Examples of tree crown buffers from radius method data with overlapping crowns for park trees (left) and street trees (right). While the frequency of overlapping crowns is much higehr for the park example, it is still apparent in the street trees as well. Given that these figures only include trees of the canary species, the occurance of overlapping tree canopies is likely even higher than this.", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics(c("figure/overlapping_park.png", "figure/overlapping_street.png"))
```

The LiDAR tree crown delineation was by far the most intensive pixel
selection method tested in this thesis, but was the most effective for
modeling purposes. In some cases (such as trees 1, 4, and 6 in figure
\@ref(fig:layered-outputs-2)) the LiDAR delineation appears to be highly
effective in creating a polygon that is representative of a tree's
crown, without the inclusion of overlapping areas. However, there are
cases (such as trees 2, 3, and 5) where the canopy delineation algorithm
creates canopies for trees that are larger than reality. The LiDAR pixel
selection method also led to the most statistically significant
predictive models. Using LiDAR for canopy delineation is complicated,
but it is also quite effective.

Given the overall results of the three methods, I believe that the
radius and LiDAR methods are both valid choices for tree crown
delineation and pixel selection, but can have different intended uses
that will maximize the benefits of each model. The radius method is
fairly easy when compared to the LiDAR processing. Especially if the
data already contains a crown width measurement, the radius method can
be a decently simple method of selecting pixels for NDVI assessment.
However, if the goal is maximizing the accuracy of the tree crown
delineations, the the LiDAR method is the best approach.

## Evaluation of Tree Health Predictions

The final LiDAR model for predicting tree health based on NDVI and
species had promising results for the two maple species, especially
ACMA. The ACMA health predictions mirrored the pattern seen in the
measured health condition and LiDAR calculated NDVI. With ACPL, the
predictions showed effective separation of **fair** and **good**, but no
predictions of **poor** trees. A limitation for all of the models is
sample size. The models were only statistically significant when the
health rating groups were downsampled to equal sizes, and the level of
statistical significance and predictions varied depending on the sample
of trees that was included in the downsampled data. Additionally, the
distribution of species across health rating with the downsampled data
is uneven (table \@ref(tab:species-counts-bleh). Due to data loss during
the LiDAR canopy delineation, the final dataset used for model training
had no PSME individuals rated as **poor** health. In the predictions, no
PSME individuals were rated as **poor**, which in context of the
training dataset makes complete sense. If there is no basis for a
prediction of a specific health rating, that health rating will not be
predicted. For all species, an overall larger sample size would likely
improve the predictions and the model as a whole. This is easier said
than done, since while collecting field data and health analyses, the
species sampled can be controlled by selection, but their health cannot
be. In order to create a predictive model that works for more than just
ACMA, it is necessary to increase the size of data for model training.

```{r, include = F}
test_data_lidar %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = health_rat, fill = species))+
  geom_bar()+
  scale_fill_manual(values = species_pal)

species_counts <- test_data_lidar %>%
  dplyr::select(species, health_rat) %>%
  count(species, health_rat) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "health_rat", values_from = "n") %>%
  mutate(poor = gtools::na.replace(poor, 0))
```

```{r species-counts-bleh, results = 'asis', echo = F}
kable(species_counts,
      booktabs = TRUE, col.names = c("Species", "Count Poor", "Count Fair", "Count Good"),
  caption = "Count of Species and Ratings in final dataset used for LiDAR downsampled model training")
```

### Impact of Functional Tree Type and Species on Tree Health Assessments

In all models and data analysis, very different patterns were seen
between the broadleaf deciduous trees (ACMA and ACPL) and the coniferous
evergreen trees (PSME and THPL). This is at least partially due to the
functional tree type and how these trees respond to environmental
conditions and declining health. Deciduous trees lose their leaves every
fall, and grow new ones every spring. Since their vegetation has a
shorter lifespan of one growing season, it is much more sensitive to
sudden and extreme environmental impacts. Declining health can be seen
in broadleaf trees as leaf damage or scorching, discoloration in the
foliage, or a decrease in the number of leaves grown each year (CITE).
Conversely, coniferous evergreen trees retain their foliage after each
growing season, adding new growth on to the end of branches. Since
evergreen trees cannot regrow all their foliage after a year with harsh
environmental conditions, their response is often seen in the loss of
branches and a reduction in overall canopy cover (CITE). Because of
these variations in response types, the models including functional type
as a predictor variable had higher levels of accuracy than the method
only using NDVI.

For each of the three pixel selection method models, the model that
differentiated the predictions by species was the most accurate. Because
of the differences in functional type and other species-specific
characteristics, it makes sense that increasing the specificity of the
model to species would improve the predictions. This additional
separation of tree species also highlighted the utility of the final
predictive model for separating ACMA individuals into distinct health
categories based on NDVI, but this did not hold true for the ACPL
predictions.

Separating the predictions by species was consistently more effective
than separating by functional type. Like with the tree crown
delineations, the species differentiation was the most effective, but
functional type specificity can do in a pinch. For the purpose of
obtaining a rough understanding of NDVI across various functional types
of trees, then specifying functional type instead of species will paint
an adequate picture of tree health. However, to maximize accuracy of
health predictions, species separation

## Limitations of Satellite Imaging

While the use of satellite imaging for urban ecology applications is
becoming more frequent, there are still numerous avenues that need
additional research and improvement. The first of those is documentation
and access.

Another limitation of satellite imaging for tree health assessment is
seasonality. Especially with deciduous trees, NDVI obtained outside of
the peak growing season will not be able to get anywhere close to an
accurate health rating based on greenness. By filtering for satellite
images collected during the peak on-leaf period, this variability can be
limited. @fang2020 compared satellite images from June, July, and August
and found that the July image, which was obtained for the peak on-leaf
period for Washington D.C., was the most accurate and effective when
examining tree health.

Tree species also has a large impact on NDVI values due to the natural
variability in tree vegetation color. Coniferous trees are generally
much darker in color than deciduous trees. Between deciduous tree
species, there can be extensive variation in color as well. Some trees
have vegetation that naturally appears reddish or purple, so these
species would require a different type of vegetation index for health
modeling than species that are naturally quite green.

## Open Source Data and Accessible Science

When beginning this thesis, a large goal of mine was to use only open
source and freely accessible data sources and programs. For the most
part, I was able to meet this goal. The satellite data I used was
accessed through PlanetScope's Education and Research Program, which
provided me with limited, non-commercial access to PlanetScope satellite
imagery. This is accessible after a short application, provided that the
applicant has a college or university email address. Both the street and
park tree inventories were publicly available through Portland's GIS
opendata site, and the LiDAR canopy height model was available through
Portland's Regional Land Information System (RLIS). The one processing
task I was not able to do on an open source software was the file
conversion of the LiDAR CHM. It is only available for download as a File
Geodatabase, which is a proprietary ArcGIS file type. In order to be
able to utilize it in QGIS, which is an opensource GIS software, I had
to open the CHM file in ArcGIS through Reed's institutional access, and
export it as a `.tif` file type. This is unfortunate, because it is very
possible for Portland's RLIS site to host the canopy height model in a
different format. While many of the data sources I used were openly
accessible, throughout this process it became apparent that the
processing techniques were not. I had to use three different platforms
(RStudio, QGIS, and Python) to conduct the work for this thesis.

Satellite imagery with a 3m pixel size is relatively high resolution,
but less so in the context of urban ecology. The satellite data used in
@fang2020 was eight multispectral bands with a resolution of 1.2m, and
one panchromatic band with a spatial resolution of 0.3m. Satellite
imagery with this resolution or higher is unavailable to the public or
even for research purposes without payment or subscription to a data
hosting site. When I was working with PlanetScope data in the summer of
2020, I reached out to Planet Labs about gaining access to their higher
resolution data products and the possibility of purchasing individual
access to the data if needed. I was told that Planet does minimum
purchase orders of \$10,000 USD. While the availability of the basic
satellite imagery through Planet Labs is an incredible resource, it is
frustrating that the high price tag severely limits the accessibility of
much of their data.

## Future Directions

For future work in modeling tree health, a combined pixel selection
using both the Radius and LiDAR methods could have promising results. By
calculating the areas of both the radius buffer circles and the LiDAR
canopies for each tree and using the smaller of the two areas, the
amount of overlapping tree crowns will be minimized along with the
overestimated LiDAR delineated crowns. Other studies have used an NDVI
threshold to exclude non-vegetation pixels, which was unrealistic to do
given the pixel size of the data I used. However, if this work could be
repeated with higher resolution NDVI data, masking of pixels based on an
NDVI threshold may be effective.

Additionally, altering the model to predict two conditions (**healthy**
vs **unhealthy**) may be more accurate, since all three pixel selection
methods had statistically significant differences between the **good**
and **fair** categories. Splitting the trees into two health categories
instead of three would increase the number of **unhealthy** trees
predicted, since the trees categorized as **fair** would be split
between the **healthy** and **unhealthy** ratings.

Given the ineffective nature of my model for predicting the health
categorizations for coniferous trees, a different direction may be
needed. One possible method of remote health analysis for coniferous
trees could be canopy cover.
