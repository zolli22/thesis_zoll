## Canopy Width and Tree Height Model

The second order polynomial model for predicting tree height based on
DBH and tree species had statistical significance for the ACMA and PSME
predictions, but not for ACPL or THPL. This is likely due to the similar
average DBH and tree height values between ACPL and PSME. While the
average DBH values for ACMA and PSME are very similar, the average
height values are extremely different, with the average PSME individual
standing twice as tall as the average ACMA individual (Table
\@ref(tab:tree-stats-table)). An issue with the second degree model is
the decrease in predicted tree height. This decrease is not seen in the
park tree model, but the street tree height predictions for all species
show a visible decrease after the inflection point of the model. Given
that the tree height predictions were only used for filtering out trees
below 25 feet in height, an extremely precise model was not necessary
for the purposes of this thesis.

The second order polynomial model for predicting canopy width based on
DBH and tree species was statistically significant for all species.
There is consistent variation in the average crown width measurements
between all species (Table \@ref(tab:tree-stats-table)). With the
visualization of the street tree canopy width predictions, the only
extreme decrease after the model inflection point is seen in the ACPL
predictions. The canopy width model played a larger role in this thesis
than the tree height model because it was essential for the radius
method of pixel selection for all street trees.

## Pixel Selection

The three pixel selection methods (point, radius, and LiDAR) were used
to help answer the question "which pixels are we using?"

```{r layered-outputs-2, out.width = "90%", fig.cap = "Point, Radius, and LiDAR pixel selection methods for Berkeley Park with numbered trees", fig.scap = "Pixel selection method comparison with numbered trees"}
include_graphics("figure/layered_outputs_2.png")

```

The point method is the simplest method, obtaining a single NDVI value
from the individual pixel that spatially contains an individual tree
location point. The statistically significant difference in the NDVI
values for trees categorized as **fair** and **good** seems to be
primarily driven by the THPL data.

Given that only one pixel value is used to represent the NDVI of an
entire tree in the point method, that single pixel likely misrepresents
the health of the tree. If the location point is incorrect, the NDVI
value may not belong to the tree of interest. The pixel method NDVI
values statistically significantly higher than the NDVI values obtained
through the other two pixel selection methods. This can be attributed to
the use of a single pixel rather than an average of pixel NDVI values.
The approximated center of the tree represented by the tree location
point will generally be greener than pixels on the edge because the NDVI
value for a pixel is the average NDVI for all data within that pixel,
and the central pixel likely contains mostly tree canopy, and ideally
little to no information on ground cover surrounding the tree. This is
emphasized in figure \@ref(fig:layered-outputs-2), which highlights the
large variance in pixel selection extent for the three methods and how
much data is missed by the point method. What is missed by the point
method is overcompensated by the radius method.

The radius method averages the NDVI values of pixels within a buffered
circle with the size defined by the measured or predicted tree canopy
width. The radius method data had a statistically significant difference
in average NDVI values between **good** and **poor** categorized trees
as well as **good** and **fair** categorized trees. There is a larger
difference between **fair** and **good** than **fair** and **poor**,
which is also seen in the point method data.
