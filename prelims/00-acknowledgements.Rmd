To my siblings: Forest, thank you for being the coolest big brother I could ever want. Anna, I am so glad that you have become part of my life - the strawberry earrings you made me have become my good luck charm this year. Sabina, thank you for the facetime calls and the junior high drama updates. Wren, thank you for the funny faces and your constant sweet encouragement. Vivian, thank you for the beanie babies and the drawings you sent me.
