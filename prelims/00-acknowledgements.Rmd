This thesis would never have been completed without the constant guidance and mentorship from Aaron Ramirez and Anna Ritz. Having the two of you as my advisers for this process was such a gift. I have learned so much from both of you, and will forever be grateful to you for keeping my head on straight this year. <br>  
To my parents- Thank you for all of your support. I truly could not have done this without you. Your constant support has been priceless throughout my entire Reed career, especially this past semester. In the most stressful moments, I knew I could depend on you for the words of motivation and encouragement I needed. I love you all very much, and I would not be where I am today without having you in my corner. <br>
To my siblings: <br>
Forrest, thank you for being the coolest big brother a girl could ever have.  <br> 
Anna, I am so glad that you have become part of my life - the strawberry earrings you made me have become my good luck charm this year. <br>
Sabina, thank you for the Facetime calls and the junior high drama updates. <br>
Wren, thank you for the funny faces and your constant sweet encouragement. <br>
Vivian, thank you for the beanie babies and the drawings you sent me.<br>
To my friends: <br>
Elin - As many cursed memories as we have from hum conference freshman year, I will always appreciate them because I also met you. Little did we know that making spaghetti in FSM fall break of freshman year would lead us to this. <br>
Victoria - <br> 
Cayden - It is a little ridiculous how irresponsible the two of us can be when left alone together. Regardless, I am so grateful and lucky to have you as one of my best friends.<br>
Brendan - <br>
Mila - I hope you know how much I appreciated our weekly lunches. <br>
