Urban trees provide numerous benefits, ranging from aesthetic and environmental to psychological and economical. Tree health is a critical part of urban ecosystem function, and is closely tied to the benefits or lack thereof that urban trees can provide. 
With over one million trees in Portland&#39;s urban forest, conducting field health assessments to understand the dynamics of tree health in Portland is a nearly impossible goal. 
Due to the size of urban forests and the time consuming practice of field health assessments, recent approaches have turned to satellite imagery as a tool for evaluating tree health. 
This thesis looks to examine the health ratings of four key tree species in Portland (*Acer macrophyllum* [ACMA], *Acer platanoides* [ACPL], *Pseudotsuga menziesii* [PSME], and *Thuja plicata* [THPL]) from field data collected in the summer of 2021, and the relationship between health rating and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), which is an index of "greenness" commonly used in remote sensing of vegetation. 

This thesis tests three different tree canopy delineation and pixel selection techniques, which are a single point method based on tree location, a circular buffer based on tree crown radius, and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) tree crown delineation, for obtaining NDVI to determine which is the most effective for examining tree health information and predicting health rating from NDVI. 

I used an ordinal logistic regression model to predict health ratings of poor, fair or good, considering both tree functional type (deciduous or broad leaf) and tree species as confounding variables, and including them as predictor variables in some of the models. The most effective predictive model differentiated the predictions by species, and used the LiDAR data. This final model was most effective for the two maple species (ACMA and ACPL), categorizing trees in all three health categories for ACMA, and two health categories for ACPL. These results show that while it may be time consuming and quite involved, using the most specific method of tree specification and crown delineation for pixel selection will provide the best results.
The ability to accurately predict health of urban trees is an important step towards efficient and effective modeling and understanding of urban forest health dynamics.
