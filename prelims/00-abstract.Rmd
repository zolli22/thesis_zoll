Urban trees provide numerous benefits, ranging from aesthetic and environmental to psychological and economical. 
Tree health is a critical part of urban ecosystem function, and is closely tied to the benefits or lack thereof that urban trees can provide. 
Due to the size of urban forests and the time consuming practice of field health assessments, recent research into tree health has turned to satellite imagery as a tool for evaluating tree health. 
This thesis tests three different tree canopy delineation techniques to determine which is the most effective for obtaining tree health information on four key species in Portland:  *Acer macrophyllum*, *Acer platanoides*, *Pseudotsuga menziesii*, and *Thuja plicata*. 
With field data collected in the summer of 2021, I created a predictive model for tree health categorization based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index.
